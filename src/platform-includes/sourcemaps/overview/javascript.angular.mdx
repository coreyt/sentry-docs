## Uploading Source Maps in an Angular project

Sentry uses [releases](/product/releases/) to match the correct source maps to your events.
This page is a guide on how to create releases and upload source maps to Sentry when bundling your Svelte app.

### Generating Source Maps

To generate source maps, you need to add the `sourceMap` option to your `angular.json` build configuration:

```json {filename:angular.json}
{
  // ...
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "configurations": {
            "production": {
              "sourceMap": {
                "scripts": true
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Uploading Source Maps

To upload your Angular project's source maps to Sentry, we recommend one of these two options:

- [**Angular CLI and Sentry Webpack Plugin**](./uploading/angular-webpack/) <br/>
  Use the Angular CLI, a custom Angular builder and the Sentry Webpack plugin to set releases and upload source maps automatically when running `ng build`.
- [**Sentry CLI**](./uploading/cli/)<br/>
  Upload source maps manually using Sentry-CLI.

Take a look at this [guide for further options to upload source maps](./uploading/).
